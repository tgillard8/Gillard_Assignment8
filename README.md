# String Analyzer

## Purpose
This script analyzes input strings and computes the number of lowercase, uppercase, symbol, and numeric characters within the string.

## Input
The script utilizes a single string as the input.

## Expected Output
The output of the script is to provide the number of lowercase, uppercase, symbol, and numeric characters after the user inputs a string.

## Execution
This script is executed via Python and is ran at the end of the chunk of the jupyter notebook cell.

## Improvements
Adding in more string inputs and a more advanced output that computes other elements as well would be very interesting. Creating a user history as well would also be compelling. Enhance UI? It is still only jupyter notebooks.
